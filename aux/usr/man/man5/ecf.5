.TH ecf 5  "April 10, 1998" "Executor 2.0v"
.SH NAME
ecf \- Executor ".ecf" configuration file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
In 
.B executor, 
the Cmd-Shift-5 key sequence brings up a preference panel that allows
you to alter Executor's behavior.  If you click on the "Save" button
from within that panel, the settings of that panel will be saved in a
file whose name is the hexadecimal representation of the file creator
of the currently running Macintosh program, with the suffix ".ecf"
added.
.PP
The format of this file isn't publicly documented, but it's a text
file, so brave souls can edit the files, but
.B executor
considers these files as machine generated and doesn't report syntax
errors
in any useful manner.
.SH FILES
/var/opt/executor/share/conf - the directory where configuration files are stored by default
.SH "SEE ALSO"
