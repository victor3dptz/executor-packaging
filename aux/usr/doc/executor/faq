This is the list of Frequently Asked Questions about Executor, the
commercial Macintosh emulator for DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Linux [see Q1.1
`What is Executor?' for more details].  This set of answers to Frequently
Asked Questions is not designed to take the place of our Executor manual.
However, currently our manual is not available on-line, so this FAQ does
briefly touch on some issues that are covered more in depth in our manual.

In addition to this FAQ, there should be README files bundled with
Executor and there is also an Executor/DOS document that describes how to
get started with Executor/DOS from a DOS user's point of view, which may
be useful to users of Executor on other platforms as well.  That document
is called "ERNSTOUD.TXT", since it's hard to come up with useful names
when constrained by the DOS 8.3 filename limits and the author of the
document is Ernst J. Oud.

Please check out these documents and this FAQ, before sending e-mail to
ARDI or the Executor Interest mailing list [see Q1.13 `What's the best way
to keep informed about Executor?'].

See Q7.7 `In what formats is this FAQ available?' for details of where to
get the PostScript, Emacs Info, HTML (WWW) and plain ASCII versions of
this document.

A new version of this document appears frequently.  If this copy is more
than a month old it may be out of date.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.1.  What is Executor?

Executor is a commercial emulator that allows non-Macintosh hardware to
run many applications originally written on a Macintosh.  Executor has
limitations [see Q2.2 `What limitations does Executor 2 have?'], but
surprisingly for emulators, speed is not one of them [see Q1.8 `How fast
is Executor?'].  Please check out a demo of Executor [see Q1.10 `Where can
I pick up the Executor demos?'].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.2.  How can I get more information about Executor?

This FAQ contains much information, but it is pale when compared to a demo
of Executor [see Q1.10 `Where can I pick up the Executor demos?'].  Beyond
the demo, almost all the publicly available information on Executor is on
our web pages <http://www.ardi.com/>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.3.  On which platforms is Executor available?

We make two Executor products: Executor for Windows and Executor for
Linux.  Linux is a Operating System for PCs.  More information about Linux
is available from places like Linux Online, but if you're happy using
Windows, you can skip all the references to Linux in this FAQ.

Executor for Windows includes both Executor/Win32 (E/W) and Executor/DOS
(E/D).  E/W runs under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and will run
under Windows 2000.  E/D runs under DOS, Windows 3.x and OS/2.

Executor/Linux (E/L) runs only on i386 systems. includes Executor/Linux/X
(supported), Executor/Linux/SVGAlib (unsupported, on its way out) and
Executor/Linux/SDL (unsupported now, but will probably be supported in the
future).

implementation that runs under Linux, with ELF libc5 and glibc versions
for both X-Windows and SVGAlib.  Executor/Linux currently runs only on
80x86 based PCs (i.e. no support for the Alpha, PPC or SPARC yet).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.4.  How much does Executor cost?

Prices will be valid through January 31st 1999 Prices include free
electronic minor-version (2.x) updates

You must be a *full-time* student (elementary through post-doc) at an
educational institution to qualify for the Student discount.

ARDI reserves the right to determine which institutions qualify as
educational institutions for the purposes of Educational and Student
discounts.

Executor for Windows costs $65 for full-time students and $150 for
everyone else.  Executor for Linux costs $35 for full-time students and
$75 for everyone else.

We offer volume discounts and site licenses.  An additional educational
discount is available to educational institutions who purchase 6 or more
copies at once.  A complete list of Executor Prices is available at
<http://www.ardi.com/prices.html>.

Question 1.6.  How do I order Executor?

Before you order, please read and understand Executor's current
limitations [see Q2.2 `What limitations does Executor 2 have?'].  You can
use our web pages to get Executor's price and even to place the order
itself.

You can also order directly from ARDI by means other than the WWW pages.
An alternative is to get Executor's current price (via the web or by
calling or FAXing us) and mail us a check [see Q1.5 `Who makes
Executor?'], FAX us (+1 505 766 5153) credit card information (VISA,
MasterCard or EuroCard only) or call us up (+1 888 BUY ARDI -- toll-free
number for orders only) so we can take down your credit card information.

We accept domestic purchase orders from most universities and most large
companies.  We no longer accept non-U.S. purchase orders without
accompanying payment and we reserve the right to refuse U.S. purchase
orders as we see fit.

NOTE: All checks and money orders must be payable in U.S. funds and be
written from a U.S. bank.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.7.  What is the correct pronunciation?

Ig-ZEK-yu-tor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.8.  How fast is Executor?

Very.  Executor converts mc680x0 instructions into 80x86 instructions.
For cpu intensive tasks, a 75 MHz 486DX4 will run approximately as quickly
as a 25 MHz 68LC040.  An entry level pentium will run 680x0 based
Macintosh applications faster than most 680x0 Macs Apple ever sold.  The
paper ftp.ardi.com : /pub/SynPaper describes how Executor runs mc68040
code so quickly on an 80x86.  SynPaper compares a few different systems
and shows that a 90 MHz Pentium runs almost as fast as a hypothetical 50
MHz 68LC040.

Graphics performance depends on which version of Executor you have, and
what type of video card you have.  Executor runs fastest when it can grab
the frame buffer and write directly to it.  One of our testing machines is
a 66 MHz DX2 with a built-in VLB video card and in 256 color mode it
displays graphics at about the same speed as our 25 MHz 68LC040 based
Quadra 610 for some common operations and at about half speed for less
common operations.  Entry level Pentiums with VESA 2 drivers are much
faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.9.  Does Executor require ROMs or System Files from Apple?

No.  Executor re-implements from scratch a subset of the routines that
make up Apple's Macintosh Operating System and Toolbox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.10.  Where can I pick up the Executor demos?

The downloading page of our web site (<http://www.ardi.com/download.html>)
is the best place.  There may be other sites that carry our demos, but our
site always receives the new versions first.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.11.  Is Executor shareware?

NO.  Executor is a commercial program.

We do make demo versions which have some significant functionality removed
from them.  The demo versions are the only versions that should be found
on bulletin boards or FTP sites.  If you find a non-limited version of
Executor available to download, it was put there illegally and it is
illegal to use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.12.  How do the demo versions differ from the full versions?

The commercial version is distributed on CD-ROM and can not be
redistributed.  The demo version, which can be redistributed under certain
circumstances, has a few limitations.

The demo will only run for 30 days.  In addition, all pages printed from
the demo version will have "Demo" written on them.  The demo version of
Executor will read Macintosh formatted floppies and hard drives but will
not allow you to write to or format them.  The remaining difference
between the demo version and the commercial version of Executor is that
Command-Key equivalents will not work in this demo version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.13.  What's the best way to keep informed about Executor?

Join the Executor Interest mailing list.  Send a message to
<executor-request@ardi.com>.  The message body should say:

subscribe

We try to post important events to the net, and send new release
information via U.S. mail to our current customers, but the Executor
mailing list is where we post news about our experimental versions and
where you can send mail to talk with other people who are using Executor.

If you'd rather get the Executor Interest information in a daily digest
form, send the same subscribe message to

<executor-digest-request@ardi.com>, instead of executor-request@ardi.com.

To remove yourself from either mailing list, send a message to the address
that you used to subscribe, saying:

unsubscribe

This will work only if you send the unsubscribe message from the same
account that you used to send the subscribe message.  You can also send a
message of "help" to <majordomo@ardi.com> and more information about how
to use it will be e-mailed to you.  If you are still having trouble, you
can send e-mail to <majordomo-owner@ardi.com> and that will be processed
by a human, although it may take a few days for the human to get around to
to your request.

Even after you have unsubscribed to the list, you will continue to get any
messages that were posted to the list before you unsubscribed but were not
actually sent immediately, but once you have unsubscribed, any new
messages that come in will not be sent to you.

The Executor mailing list is currently unmoderated and usually has several
messages a day posted to it.  There is a separate mailing list that only
ARDI employees can post to and is used only to announce new Executor
things (experimental releases, major bugs, etc.).  It works just like the
other two mailing lists, in that you send "subscribe" e-mail to a special
address to be added to the list.  The address you send to is
<executor-announce-request@ardi.com>.

If you have access to usenet, there's also comp.emulators.mac.executor,
the usenet newsgroup devoted to Executor.  In fact, the Executor mailing
list used to be gatewayed to comp.emulators.mac.executor, but the volume
of off-topic posts was too great to continue the gateway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.14.  What's the Executor Interest mailing list?

See Q1.13 `What's the best way to keep informed about Executor?'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1.15.  Will you port Executor to BeOS, SPARC, Alpha, PPC ...?

ROMlib itself is easily portable to any platform that supports gcc.
Syn68k is portable.  The SDL
<http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/SDL/index.html> front-end
that we use for Executor/Win32 is also portable.  So, with a little work,
it should be possible to port Executor to a wide variety of platforms.
However, currently (Mid 1999), we can't afford to commit to any of the
above ports (officially).

Section 2.  Executor's Limitations

 Q2.1        What version of the Macintosh operating system does Executor emula
 Q2.2        What limitations does Executor 2 have?
 Q2.3        If I have 800 KB floppies, what can I do?
 Q2.4        Does Executor run all applications?
 Q2.5        What percentage of applications will run under Executor?
 Q2.6        Does Executor have networking support?
 Q2.7        How do you install Fonts and Desk Accessories (DAs)?
 Q2.8        Will Desk Accessories work under Executor?
 Q2.9        Does Executor run xxx?
 Q2.10       Can Executor run Japanese system software?
 Q2.11       Why do some installers not work?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.1.  What version of the Macintosh operating system does Executor emulate?

Executor knows how to emulate most of System 7.0, but the default version
that Executor reports to applications is System 6.0.7, because some bad
programs make calls to undocumented System 7.0 traps if we acknowledge
that we've implemented System 7.0.  Each time a different application is
run under Executor, Executor checks an application specific configuration
file for application specific settings.  Many of the configuration files
adjust the System to 7.0.

You can manually adjust the system version.  Start Executor and call up
the Preferences Panel with Cmd-shift-5 [see Q3.1 `Where are the Cmd
(Clover) and Option keys?'].  Set the System to 7 and click OK (don't save
yet; these are just the Browser settings).  Now start your application,
call up the Preferences Panel again, and save it with the System 7
setting.  After that, Executor will automatically invoke System 7 support
when you run that application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.2.  What limitations does Executor 2 have?

Because the OS and Toolbox have been rewritten from scratch, Executor 2
has limitations, including no serial port access, no modem use, no
AppleTalk, primitive sound, limited System 7 support, no INITs, no CDEVs
and no Internationalization.

Executor can read and write 1.44 MB Mac formatted floppy disks, but due to
limitations in PC hardware, *can't* read or write 800 KB floppy disks.

In the lab we have limited serial port access and we're working on
improving sound.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.3.  If I have 800 KB floppies, what can I do?

Very little.  It is not ARDI's fault and there's nothing we can do about
it, but the way that Apple squeezed 800 KB onto floppies when PCs were
only getting 720 KB on floppies was to write more data on the floppy
tracks far from the center than on the tracks near the center.  This was
clever, but extremely incompatible.

There *are* ways to squeeze more information onto PC floppy drives than
PCs usually use.  However, these methods *cannot* be used to write or even
read 800 KB Macintosh formatted floppies.

Luckily, very little is supplied on 800 KB floppies anymore, but if you
have some, you're almost definitely going to need the use of a Macintosh
somewhere to copy the contents onto "HD" 1.4 MB formatted floppies (PCs
and Macs use the same low-level format for 1.4 MB floppies).

One Executor Enthusiast suggested using Kinko's public Macs for this
purpose, and this description was given:

1.  Moving 800 KB Mac Files onto 1.44 MB Mac disks.  The easiest thing
that I have found when working on a real Mac is to preformat the
Mac disks to 1.44 MB.  Insert the 1.44 MB disk and eject it with
(Cmd-E).  Then insert the 800 KB mac disk.  Drag the icon of the 800
KB disk over the 1.44 MB disk.  All the files will be transferred as
will the file names.  The Mactools fastcopy program can also copy
between densities.

2.  Kinko's Public Machines.  Kinko's public Macs are equipped with a
program known as "Desk Tracy" which is designed to stop people from
pirating Kinko's software from the hard disk.  The problem is that when
you are copying files between your own disks the program will still
trigger if the file has a namesake on the Kinko's machine. What you
will need to do is get a Kinko's employee to shut the program off,
which is obviously a discretionary call with them.  I didn't have a
problem and have done it twice, but we obviously will be using
different Kinko's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.4.  Does Executor run all applications?

Currently, no.  Some applications won't run because they require something
that we currently don't support (e.g.  QuickTime).  Additionally the MacOS
is sufficiently poorly defined that even a rewrite that obeys the
documentation will not be sufficiently compatible to allow all
applications to work.  For this reason, we make demo versions of Executor
available for potential customers to run before purchasing Executor [see
Q1.10 `Where can I pick up the Executor demos?'].  We also work hard
tracking down the unwritten compatibility issues that interfere with
Executor [see Q2.9 `Does Executor run xxx?'].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.5.  What percentage of applications will run under Executor?

This is another question that remains tough to answer.  As our
compatibility database grows, our approximation becomes more accurate.

A *very rough* estimate is that Executor will run between 60% and 80% of
Macintosh programs which don't run into one of its known limitations (see
Q2.2 `What limitations does Executor 2 have?').  If you're interested in a
particular Macintosh program, your best bet is to check the compatibility
database on our web pages: <http://www.ardi.com/compat/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.6.  Does Executor have networking support?

Currently, no.  Some Networking support may be included in Executor 3, but
we do not yet have an estimated date of completion for Executor 3.  The
first platform to have networking support built in will probably be Linux.
NOTE: networking support will most likely first be an implementation of
Open Transport and/or MacTCP, followed by EtherTalk.  Supporting AppleTalk
over serial lines is unlikely to happen due to differences in PC and Mac
hardware.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.7.  How do you install Fonts and Desk Accessories (DAs)?

You just drag them into the hot-band and our browser will do the right
thing.  However, we only support bit-mapped fonts, not Type 1 or TrueType
fonts.  In addition, there is a bug which causes the hot-band to forget
which desk accessories have been loaded, which then makes it impossible to
remove desk accessories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.8.  Will Desk Accessories work under Executor?

Currently Desk Accessory support is very weak; most will not run.  When we
add support for extensions, we'll also go back and fix some desk accessory
bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.9.  Does Executor run xxx?

We maintain a compatibility database <http://www.ardi.com/compat/> that
consists of submissions from users of Executor.  It's a good place to look
when you have questions about a specific application.  If there's no entry
in the database, please consider submitting one after you've tried it
under Executor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.10.  Can Executor run Japanese system software?

Executor 2 can't.  Executor 3 won't be able to unless such a project is
specifically funded from an outside source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.11.  Why do some installers not work?

Currently there is one major class of application installer that is known
not to work with Executor.  Installers based on Apple's old Installer do
not work.  An example is Microsoft Word 5's installer.  Some installers
require that you use Cmd-shift-5 and set the system version to 7 and turn
on the "Pretend" options before they'll work properly.

 Q3.19       How does your Browser show free space?
 Q3.20       Why does Browser display question marks for some documents?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.1.  Where are the Cmd (Clover) and Option keys?

On a PC keyboard, Executor uses the left "Alt" key as a Cmd key and the
right "Alt" key as the Option key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.2.  What is an image file?

Some Macintosh sites contain image files that are exact copies of a
Macintosh Hierarchical FileSystem (HFS) volume with a few bytes of header
information prepended.  Executor allows you to use image files just like
HFVs, although they should have the suffix ".ima" instead of ".hfv".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.3.  Can I launch applications directly from the command line?

Yes.  If an application resides within a UNIX or DOS filesystem, you can
specify the name of the application, and documents that you would like the
application to open when it starts up, on the command line.  Applications
that reside in HFV files are specified using colons to delimit the
pathname, e.g. "executor MyVolume:directory:application".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.4.  I installed a font in Executor, but I still can't print in it.  What's the deal?

You have to install the same font in Ghostscript.  Otherwise, Ghostscript
will use the default Helvetica font since it can't find the one you want.
Don't forget to add the paths to the fonts into your fonts pfb file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.5.  What are all the command line switches?

If you type "executor -help" it will list all the command line switches it
knows about and give a brief description of what they do.  You can capture
the help text to a file by typing
executor -help > helpfile
then you can look at helpfile with your favorite editor.

Here is a list of the most useful switches:

The "desperate" switch for DOS will start Executor in minimalist mode.
This is useful when trying to track down a problem which is preventing
Executor from running.

The "size" switch lets you set the screen size.  Executor/Linux under X
also understands the standard "geometry" switch.

The "nobrowser" switch prevents Executor from trying to run the file
browser upon startup.  Sometimes this is a handy to start an application a
little more quickly and other times it can be useful if the browser save
file gets corrupted and the browser refuses to run.

The switches "bpp" and "refresh" affect how the screen is emulated.  The
number of bits per pixel that the program running under Executor sees is
specified by bpp.  If bpp is set to 1, then there are only two "colors"
(black and white) available.  If it is set to 8, then 256 colors are
available.  For Executor/DOS, you need a SVGA board with a VESA compatible
driver to get 8 bits per pixel and screen sizes larger than 640x480.

The switches applzone, syszone and stack control how much memory is
allocated to the application, the system, and the application stack. The
memory switch assigns a certain amount of memory to to Executor and lets
Executor choose how it should be divided.  In general, if you have more
than 4 MB, you should override the default and allow Executor to use more
memory.  All four of these switches can understand values expressed with m
(for MB) or k (for kilobytes).

For X windows users, privatecmap specifies that Executor should use a
private colormap.  This is the fastest graphics mode and gives you the
most accurate colors, but at the expense of radically changed colors in
your other windows whenever the cursor is in the Executor window, and
radically changed colors in the Executor window whenever the cursor is
outside of it.  Because this is annoying, this mode is not the default.
When not in this mode, the pixels in Executor's internal frame buffer are
converted to the nearest X colors before being drawn to the screen.

Here is an example of some of those switches:

executor -applzone 4m -size 800x600

That would allocate 4 MB of memory for the application's use and set the
screen size to 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.6.  Are there other parameters I can adjust? [aka "Preferences Panel"]

Yes, when Executor is running, you can hold down Cmd-Shift-5 and get a
preferences panel.  That panel will let you adjust various settings,
similar to, but not as slick, as a Macintosh Control Panel.  If you Save a
preferences panel configuration, the values are saved for the particular
application you are running at the time.  This is handy, because some
games need to be run in 16 colors mode, so you can have Executor do that
automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.7.  Can I have Executor use more than 8 MB for the application zone?

You can use up to 64 MB for the applzone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.8.  An application I'm trying crashes.  What should I do?

Perhaps the most common avoidable cause of crashes is insufficient memory
for the emulated application.  You can fix this by increasing the
"applzone" parameter.  For example, many programs which normally die
quickly will work with "executor -applzone 4m" (which allocates 4 MB of
space for the emulated application; see the list of command line switches
and their meanings elsewhere in this document).

DOS NOTE: If you run "executor -info", it will tell you how much DPMI
memory is available and how much memory is being used by the applzone,
syszone and stack.  If there is less DPMI memory available than the sum of
the applzone, syszone and stack memory requirements, then Executor will
page between DPMI memory and a special "paging" disk file.  This paging
slows you down and also consumes disk space.  It is possible to manually
override the applzone, syszone and stack defaults with smaller values, but
when you do so, you run the risk of not having enough memory for an
application to run.  Unfortunately, Macintosh programs are often not
polite at all when they do not have enough memory.  The Lemmings demo is
an example of such a program; if you run that program on a real Mac and
only give it 1200k of memory, weird errors will occur.  Doing the same
under Executor will also yield weird errors.

If Executor needs to make a paging file, and there is not enough disk
space to create one, you will get an error message during Executor's
startup.  If you have the environment variable "TEMP" set, then Executor
will try to place its paging file there, so if TEMP is set to point to a
small RAM disk, or a disk that is nearly filled, Executor may run out of
memory too easily.

Some programs are unhappy with Executor's limited sound support, and
crash.  You can turn on the "pretend sound" option before running the
application in question and see if this helps.  In addition, some programs
have menu items, or preference check boxes that can be used to disable
sound.  It is always recommended that you disable sound from within a
program in addition to using the Executor sound preferences, if you have
to disable sound.

One example of a program that will have problems with sound is "Ultimate
Solitaire".  If you do not disable sound from within Ultimate Solitaire,
the game will play fine, until you win.  At that point it will tell
Executor to start playing a sound and request that Executor notify it when
the sound is done playing.  If sound is off, this will result in Ultimate
Solitaire hanging after you win a game.

Some programs also save preferences in a file, and if something bad
happens to that file, the program can then get confused and will not run
properly.  Occasionally this happens to Microsoft Word, and you need to
use the browser to delete the file "Word Preferences" from your "System
Folder".

Although it should not happen, even our file browser keeps a file around
that can cause trouble if it becomes corrupt.  That file is "godata.sav".
It stores which folders you have open and the contents of your "hot-band".
If that file gets corrupt, the file browser may not run.  In the rare case
that the browser won't run, you can use the "-nobrowser" switch when you
start Executor to bypass the browser, but to get the browser back you'll
need to either delete "godata.sav" somehow or replace exsystem.hfv with
one from the original distribution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.9.  Why do some applications claim I don't have an FPU?

The problem is probably that the applications you are trying to use try to
directly manipulate the FPU unit that some Macintoshes have.

The key words are "directly manipulate".  Apple warned software makers to
not directly manipulate the FPU, but to instead use their numerics library
("SANE" Standard Apple Numerics Environment).  Programs that don't use
SANE, but directly manipulate the FPU run faster on Macs that have FPUs,
but don't run at all on Macs that don't have FPUs.  If that is actually
the source of your problems, then such programs also wouldn't run on Apple
machines like the Quadra 605.  This limitation is also present on Apple's
PowerPC based Macs.

One workaround for this problem is an "INIT" called "SoftFPU".  SoftFPU
will make a Mac without a co-processor work as though there is one there,
however the floating point computation will be done very slowly.  However,
SoftFPU can't be used with Executor until Executor supports INITs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.10.  Why does Compact Pro have trouble with multi-volume archives?

Executor takes a short cut that causes trouble for some programs; Compact
Pro is one of them.  The problem is that a real Macintosh can keep track
of volumes that are not physically in the drive.  That is why Macintoshes
sometimes tell you to put one disk in their floppy drive, then they eject
it and ask for another one, then eject it and ask for the first one.
Executor currently isn't so clever.  When a disk is ejected, Executor
forgets about it.  Few programs count on the behavior of a real Mac, but
those that do currently won't work with Executor.

In Compact Pro's case you can just copy all of the pieces of the archive
to your hard disk, then open the last piece from the hard disk and
everything will work properly.  This workaround requires more hard disk
space than you'd need if you could just read the pieces off a succession
of floppies.

Since this difference affects very few programs, it's not as high priority
as adding other new features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.11.  How can I use Mac software from the internet?

Find a site that legitimately has Mac software for use.  There is a
Macintosh FAQ that lists many sites -- here are some of them:

* www.ardi.com : /pub/samples (USA)
* liquify.isca.uiowa.edu : /mac/infomac (USA)
* wuarchive.wustl.edu : /systems/mac/info-mac (USA)
* ftp.technion.ac.il : /pub/unsupported/mac (Israel)
* ftp.sunset.se : /pub/mac (Sweden)
* src.doc.ic.ac.uk : /packages/info-mac (UK)
* ftp.is.co.za : /info-mac (South Africa)

Our samples directory is there to give you a few files in a variety of
different formats that are known to work with Executor.  If you have
trouble downloading Mac software from the internet, you may want to
practice these instructions using the files in our samples directory
first, so you'll know you're not attempting something impossible.

Before transferring a large application, you might want to see what the
requirements of that application are, most sites have a collection of
small notes about applications that you can look at first.

Use BINARY mode to transfer the files that you want to use.  Files whose
names end in ".hqx" are usually the easiest to handle.

In general, StuffIt Expander will do well with many different types of
files.  However, some of the Web Browsers out there interfere with StuffIt
Expander by trying to expand the files as you're downloading them from the
net.  The browser sees that you're not running on a Macintosh, so the
non-Macintosh information (like the type and creator) is thrown away!  One
way to avoid this problem with some of the web browsers is to hold the
shift key down when you click on a link that contains a Macintosh file.
There are other ways that specific browsers can be configured to tell them
to *not* expand Macintosh files as they're picking them up.

Under DOS, you need to make an HFV file [see Q6.2 `What is makehfv?'] that
will be large enough to hold the files as you've downloaded them and also
hold the files after they've been expanded.  Once you've made the HFV
file, copy all the files you've downloaded into it, then follow the
remaining directions.

Under all operating systems, your next step is to run StuffIt Expander and
use the "Expand..." menu item from the "File" menu to open each of the
files you've downloaded.  In general, especially when dealing with files
whose names end in ".hqx", StuffIt Expander will do the right thing.
However, some sites do not store files in ".hqx" format, and StuffIt
Expander may fail.  Remember, under DOS, you must do the StuffIt Expansion
inside an HFV file.

If StuffIt Expander fails, you can try using the Get Info option of
Executor's browser to change the creator and type information of the file.
If you believe the downloaded file in question is a StuffIt Archive, you
can change the type and creator each to "SIT!" and then try StuffIt
Expander again.  If you believe the downloaded file is a Compact Pro
archive, you can change the creator to "CPCT" and the type to "PACT" and
then try StuffIt Expander again.  Similarly, you can use creator "BnHq"
and type "TEXT" if you think that the file is a MacBinary file.  StuffIt
Expander 4.0 should be much better at automatically determining what
format an archive is in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.12.  How can I use Mac software from Bulletin Boards?

In general, follow the procedure in Q3.11 `How can I use Mac software from
the internet?' -- know the limitations of what Executor can run, transfer
in binary mode and use StuffIt Expander to unpack the files you download.
Just like with files downloaded from the internet, sometimes you'll need
to change the file type and creator, first.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.13.  How can I use Mac software from AOL?

AOL sometimes (about half the time) uses a format that StuffIt Expander
under Executor has trouble with.  For DOS/Windows users, use this
workaround.  Get a copy of unstuff.exe (available on AOL compressed as
unsitins.exe) and use the -mb tag to convert your downloaded files to
MacBinary format before ever moving them into Executor.  E.g.:

unstuff -mb somefile.sit
And you'll get somefile with a different extension.

Then start up Executor and use BinHex's Download --> Application function
to convert the file to an application and move it into an Executor volume
simultaneously.

Note that if the file can be unstuffed in the usual manner, then trying to
use this workaround will break it.  It's usually best, therefore, to try
normal unstuffing first.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.14.  Why do files which aren't text files look like text files?

Macintosh files have File Type and File Creator information stored in
their directory entries on a Macintosh filesystem.  These two pieces of
information are often lost when the file is put onto a PC.  Executor's
default is to assume that a file is a text file, because text is the most
universal of file types.  If the file is not a text file you'll probably
want to use StuffIt Expander (see Q3.11 `How can I use Mac software from
the internet?') to expand the archive, or in rare cases you'll have to
change the File Creator and File Type.

To change a file's Creator and Type information, run Browser, select the
file's icon, and choose Get Info from Browser's File menu.  Then change
File Creator and File Type to the appropriate codes from the filetype.txt
list in the docs directory of your Executor CD.

NOTE: in addition to having Type and Creator information, Macintosh files
also often have information in the "Resource Fork" portion of the file.
That information is also often lost when a file is transferred to a PC, so
it's possible that changing the Type and Creator information will not be
sufficient to allow you to use a Mac file on a PC under Executor unless
you use some sort of archiving program (e.g. StuffIt, Compact Pro) to make
sure all the Mac information is stored in the "Data Fork" of the file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.15.  What does "You may open a 32000 character selection" mean?

As mentioned in Q3.14 `Why do files which aren't text files look like text
files?', files that don't have a file type are assumed to be text files.
That means that if you double-click on them, Tex-Edit will try to open up
the file, even if the file is in some other representation.  Executor does
not use filename extensions to determine a file's types, so if you
download a file named "testfile.bin" and then let Executor see the file,
it will still appear to be a text file, even though the name strongly
suggests that it's a BinHex file.

You can use StuffIt Expander (see Q3.11 `How can I use Mac software from
the internet?') to expand a variety of different file types, but you'll
have to start StuffIt Expander up directly, by double-clicking on it and
then use the "Expand..." item in the "File" menu to select the file you
want to expand (e.g. "testfile.bin").

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.16.  What is Speedometer?

Speedometer is a shareware application that we have included with Executor
for demonstrational purposes.  We have done so with permission of
Speedometer's author, Scott Berfield.  It benchmarks Macintoshes (and PCs
running Executor) to find out how quickly their CPU, graphics, floating
point and disk subsystems work.  The current version of Speedometer is
Speedometer 4.x, but that uses a timing mechanism that Executor currently
doesn't support.  Speedometer 3.23 can give you a rough approximation of
how quickly your PC is emulating a Mac.  Remember, Speedometer is
shareware, and ARDI has not paid the shareware fee for you.  If you
repeatedly use Speedometer, please register it with Scott.

Speedometer will show you that Executor is a very efficient emulator.
Please note, ARDI has not put special hooks into Executor to recognize
Speedometer's code and bypass it; Speedometer is treated just like any
other application when run under Executor.  Yes, it would be possible for
us to cheat and make Speedometer return values that are higher than you
could expect to see in real life, but we don't do that sort of thing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.17.  How can I get a screen dump of Executor?

Just type Cmd-Shift-3, just like on a Mac.  The difference is that the
screen shot will be in TIFF format (uncompressed, for now) and will be
written in the directory that contains executor.exe under DOS, or in /tmp
under Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.18.  How does your Browser show file size?

Listing mode will show you the combined size of a file's resource and data
fork.  There is currently no way to determine the size of a folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.19.  How does your Browser show free space?

Select the volume, then choose "Get Info" from the File menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.20.  Why does Browser display question marks for some documents?

Browser uses the question-mark icon for documents for which it doesn't
recognize the file type and creator.  Furthermore, Browser isn't good
about remembering type and creator information.

Here's how Browser works: when Browser starts, it examines each
application that is either on the hot-band or is in a folder that is open
on Browser's desktop.  Then, as it is drawing the icons for documents, it
only uses icons for those applications that it saw upon startup.

So, if the application that creates a document isn't either on the
hot-band or in an open folder, browser will present a question-mark icon.
A real Mac remembers any icons that it has ever seen (until you rebuild
the desktop).

If you have the application that corresponds to the document that has a
question mark, you can get rid of the question mark by dragging the
application onto the hot-band and then quitting Executor and restarting
(or by running an application and then quitting the application).  When
Browser restarts it will see the application in the hot-band and then
remember the icon that should be used for documents of that type.

Section 4.  Executor/Win32

 Q4.1        How does Executor/Win32 compare to Executor/DOS?
 Q4.2        How do I use command-line switches with Executor/Win32?
 Q4.3        Why do I get only a black screen when running Executor/Win32?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4.1.  How does Executor/Win32 compare to Executor/DOS?

Executor/Win32 is a Win32 application and can run only under Windows 95 or
later and Windows NT 4 or later.  For those platforms, Executor/Win32 is
preferred, since it will usually have fewer compatibility problems and it
runs in its own window, or full-screen.  Some people are still running
OS/2, Windows 3.x or even DOS, and they can't run Executor/Win32.
Additionally, Executor/Win32 can't be run on a SX-class 386 machine.  Such
machines are very old and very slow, but they can still run Executor/DOS.

Our product, Executor for Windows, includes both Executor/Win32 and
Executor/DOS, so you don't have to choose one or the other when ordering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4.2.  How do I use command-line switches with Executor/Win32?

Command-line switches (see Q3.5 `What are all the command line switches?')
can be used by creating a short-cut or by creating the file commands.txt,
or a combination of both.

To use command-line switches with a short-cut, you need to create a
short-cut to executor.exe, then select it and choose "Properties..." using
your right mouse.  The Properties panel has several tabs, one of which is
labeled "Shortcut".  After selecting the Shortcut tab, you can then edit
the "Target:" field.  Keep the information that is already in there (e.g.
"C:\ExecWin32\executor.exe") and then add a space, followed by the
command-line option(s) you want to use when you double-click on that
short-cut (e.g. " -size 800x600 -applzone 4m").

Since you can use command-line switches to specify a Macintosh program for
Executor to run, you can create individual short-cuts for individual
programs (e.g. " C:\ExecWin32\Apps\Freeware\Risk!").

If you have some command-line switches that you want to apply to *all*
invocations of Executor, you can create a file called commands.txt in the
same directory that includes executor.exe.  You can put all the switches
on one line, or use a separate line for each switch.

Switches in commands.txt override the ones that are specified in
short-cuts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4.3.  Why do I get only a black screen when running Executor/Win32?

You've encountered a bug.  The bug may be in your video driver or in the
screen-accessing DLLs that Executor uses.

To see if it's in your video driver, try adjusting your Display settings.
In the Control Panel there's a Display icon.  Double-clicking that should
let you select a panel named "Settings", which probably has an
"Advanced..." button.  If you click the "Advanced..." button, you should
be able to select a panel named "Performance".  Try turning the
Performance down and see if that fixes the problem.  You might also want
to try downloading a newer driver from the maker of your video card.

To see if it's our screen-accessing DLLs, Try renaming the file
"SDL-dx5.dll" to "SDL-dx5.dll.SAVE".  That will prevent Executor from
seeing that DLL, so Executor will then use a different DLL (SDL-dib.dll)
which will cause it to access the screen in a different way.  If that
solves it, then you may have found a bug in SDL-dx5.dll.  If so, please
send e-mail to <bugs@ardi.com> and let us know.

 Q5.10       Can I Macintosh format disk drives?
 Q5.11       How can Executor be configured for multiple users?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.1.  Why does my copy of Executor/Linux segfault immediately?

You're probably running Red Hat Linux 5.0 or another "glibc based"
distribution.  If so, you need the glibc version of Executor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.2.  I can't get the option key to work under X. What should I do?

Executor doesn't map raw keys to Mac modifiers, instead it uses the X
"Meta" (mod1) modifier to mean command-key and the X "Mode Switch" (mod3)
modifier to mean option-key.  Many X configurations automatically set up
the left Alt to be Meta and the right Alt to be mode switch, but not all.

If you're using XFree86, check to make sure your XF86Config file doesn't
have the right-alt function definition commented out.  They are commented
out by default in some distributions.

If you're not using XFree86, or you don't want to change your XF86Config
file, you can use xmodmap to make your right Alt key be "Mode Switch"
(mod3):

xmodmap -e 'remove mod1 = Alt_R' -e 'add mod3 = Alt_R'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.3.  Why is there no Executor for NetBSD or FreeBSD?

We don't currently have the manpower to support it.  NOTE: "support" is
different from "port" -- porting it is easy.  Training tech. support and
buying more dedicated equipment is what we can't do quite yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.4.  Where are the bitmaps stored on the Linux version of executor?

All versions of Executor maintain an internal bitmap corresponding to the
actual screen.  We accrue a "dirty rectangle" as the program draws to what
it thinks is the screen via Executor's QuickDraw implementation.  We
periodically update the _real_ screen (e.g., the X window) by transferring
the "dirty rect" across.  So basically our graphics interface to the host
machine consists of nothing more than blitting rectangles to the screen,
which aids our portability.  Under X, we use shared memory extensions for
speed, but we don't do anything fancy like trying to cache Mac fonts on
the X server side.  Spending time trying to do so would be a bad idea for
a number of reasons we won't go into.

"Refresh" mode is useful when the program directly manipulates the frame
buffer itself.  In this mode, we periodically analyze the internal screen
memory to decide what has been changed, and transfer the changed data to
the real screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.5.  My mouse won't work with the SVGALIB version.  What's the deal?

Make sure your mouse works with other SVGAlib programs before you suspect
there's an Executor specific problem.  Make sure your
/etc/vga/libvga.config file contains the proper mouse information and that
/dev/mouse is a symbolic link to the right device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.6.  How do I get E/L to see my second floppy drive?

Before running Executor, set the MacVolumes environment variable to point
to the entry in "/dev" that represents your B: drive, as:

Using "sh", "bash" or other Bourne Shell like shell:

	$ export MacVolumes="/dev/fd1"
Using "csh", "t-csh" or other C Shell like shell:

	% setenv MacVolumes "/dev/fd1"
This should work as long as you have permission to access the drive in
question ("/dev/fd1" in the above example).  If it doesn't, try using the
-nodrivesearch switch to disable Executor's usual probing for devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.7.  Why does Lemmings's splash screen take so long to be drawn?

Executor/Linux tries to cooperate with X-Windows when assigning colors.
That leaves X in charge of "the colormap", which means Executor can't
quickly change the colors in the colormap itself.  If you use the
"-privatecmap" option when you start Executor, you'll find that Lemmings
splash screen will come up much quicker, but you'll also experience the
"creepy colors" problem in other windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.8.  What free projects has ARDI supported?

ARDI sent a copy, with the appropriate legal release, of its HFS
implementation to Paul Hargrove to aid him with his implementation of a
true HFS filesystem under Linux.  This saved him considerable time reverse
engineering various undocumented aspects of HFS.

To build Executor/DOS, ARDI uses DJGPP, a free 32-bit programming
environment for DOS based mostly on GNU tools.  As users of DJGPP, we have
contributed bug fixes and some source code to the project.  For more
information about DJGPP, see <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>.

ARDI has also done a minor rewrite of Checker to make it much faster and
fix many bugs.  Unfortunately, the modifications were in the hands of one
of ARDI's contractors and appear to have slipped through the sands of
time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.9.  Is Executor localized for languages other than English?

Not yet.  We recently added international keyboard support, so romantic
language localization is not difficult, per-se, but we're concentrating on
building awareness of Executor in English speaking countries first.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.10.  Can I Macintosh format disk drives?

Yes, but if you do not consider yourself a UNIX wizard, you probably
shouldn't do it.  All you have to do is find out the formatted disk
capacity and then run makehfv [See Q6.2 `What is makehfv?'] with arguments
so it writes directly to the disk drive you want formatted.  You can only
do this if you have write permissions on the drive in question.  Obviously
all data currently residing on that drive will be lost, and if you make a
typo and inadvertently specify the wrong drive, you'll erase the data on
the wrong drive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5.11.  How can Executor be configured for multiple users?

Executor has a variety of environment variables that can be altered to
allow individual users to override the default locations Executor expects
to find key files.  Here are the important environment variables and their
default values:

* ConfigurationFolder "+/Configuration"
* SystemFolder "+/ExecutorVolume/System Folder"
* PublicDirectoryMap "+/DirectoryMap"
* PrivateDirectoryMap "~/.Executor/DirectoryMap"
* DefaultFolder "+/ExecutorVolume"
* MacVolumes "+/exsystem.hfv;+"
* ScreenDumpFolder "/tmp"

The leading "+/" represents the directory "/usr/local/lib/executor".  So
to allow multiple users to all have their own preferences, you can create
an executor directory for each potential user like this:

~/executor/
    ~/executor/Configuration
    ~/executor/SystemFolder
    ~/executor/ScreenDumps
Then reassign these environment variables:

* ConfigurationFolder "~/executor/Configuration"
* SystemFolder "~/executor/SystemFolder"
* PublicDirectoryMap "~/DirectoryMap"
* DefaultFolder "~/executor"
* ScreenDumpFolder "~/executor/ScreenDumps"

You'll then need to populate the System Folder either with copies of
what's in "/usr/local/lib/executor/ExecutorVolume/System Folder", or with
symbolic links to the actual files.  The Desktop Textures program actually
modifies the System File, so if different users are going to want
different desktops, or if you want to make sure there's no interference
between users, then you should use copies rather than symbolic links.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.1.  What is an HFV file?

Executor has the ability to store an entire Macintosh "volume" (i.e.
filesystem corresponding to a disk drive or a partition within a disk
drive) in a DOS or UNIX file.  Under DOS, this feature is very handy
because there is no way to have files with long names and upper and lower
case characters in their names unless you use an HFV file.  See Q6.2 `What
is makehfv?'.

In general, HFV files should have filenames that end in ".hfv".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.2.  What is makehfv?

The program makehfv (formerly called mkvol) allows you to create virtual
Macintosh volumes [see Q6.1 `What is an HFV file?'].  It is now part of
all Executor distributions, although it is more useful under DOS than
under Windows or Linux.

To use makehfv you need to pick a name for the new HFV file, a name for
the Macintosh volume that your new HFV file will represent and the number
of kilobytes or megabytes that you want the HFV file to use.  Here's an
example that creates a file named "bigtest.hfv" that will appear in
Executor as "BigTest" and will have 10 MB of space in it.

makehfv bigtest.hfv BigTest 10m

Executor/DOS will automatically see HFV files if they are placed in the
same directory as executor.exe, which is usually C:\EXECUTOR and their
names have the suffix ".hfv".

Executor/Linux will automatically see HFV files if they are placed in the
same directory as ExecutorVolume (NOTE: *not* in ExecutorVolume itself),
which is usually /usr/local/lib/executor and their names have the suffix
".hfv".

If you're using DOS or Windows, if you use a compressed filesystem or if
you plan to make a compressed archive containing an HFV file, you'll want
to use the "-zeros" command line option to makehfv.  That tells makehfv to
explicitly write zeros in the new hfv which takes a little more time but
makes the resulting HFV file much more compressible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.3.  How can I create my own HFV files?

See Q6.2 `What is makehfv?'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.4.  What are the hardware requirements for Executor/DOS?

Required: '386 or better, VGA, 15 MB disk space, and 4 MB RAM.  A SCSI
Controller is needed only if you want to access external Macintosh hard
disks or PowerBooks.

Recommended: '486 or better, SVGA, 15 MB disk space, and 8 MB RAM.  A SCSI
Controller is needed only if you want to access external Macintosh hard
disks or PowerBooks.

Executor/DOS 2 should work in sixteen colors on any VGA.  In addition, if
you have a Super VGA that is VESA 1.0 compliant, Executor/DOS should be
able to provide 256 colors and a range of screen sizes.  If you have a
video card that is VESA 2.0 compliant, Executor's graphics will be
significantly faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.5.  What do I do if my Super VGA card isn't VESA compliant?

There is a shareware SVGA utility that provides VESA compliance for SVGA
cards that normally are not VESA compliant.  SciTech Display Doctor is
available from <http://www.scitechsoft.com/>.  If you use it, you should
pay the shareware fee as described in the documentation.  If you have a
recent SVGA card you probably don't need SciTech Display Doctor, although
it may improve Executor's performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.6.  Why is there a bright white border on the screen?

The problem starts with Macs and PCs using different values to represent
white and black.  That's not too big of a problem, because Executor knows
about this difference and translates things appropriately.  The rest of
the problem has to do with the fact that on video screens (unlike on
laptop screens) there is a part of the screen that is outside the pixel
area that is still illuminated by the video gun.  That portion of the
screen is known as the "overscan" area and the VESA 2.0 specs don't
provide a way to set what color the overscan should be displayed as.
Instead they use the value that is used for the binary representation that
represents black on PCs.  That works well, except we're already mapping
that representation to be white.

This only happens when Executor detects and can use a "linear
framebuffer".  That's the fast way that allows Executor to write directly
to the screen without an intermediate copy to an offscreen representation
of the Mac screen.  If we can't get access to a linear framebuffer then we
can use the normal PC color mapping and patch things up as we transfer
from the offscreen image.  That allows the overscan area to be black but
it's actually slower (significantly slower for some games).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.7.  E/D dies during startup.  Why?

The most common cause of E/D not running under DOS is the lack of file
descriptors that you might get if you don't have the line:

FILES=30
in your config.sys.  If Executor is giving you trouble and you don't have
such a line in your config.sys file, please add it, or if you have a
smaller number than 30, please increase your number to 30.  There is no
reason to decrease your number if it is greater than 30.

Windows NT doesn't use config.sys, instead you need to use the
configuration file that is listed when you get to the "Program" portion of
"Properties" and click on the WindowsNT button.  The default Config
Filename is

%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG.NT
"%SystemRoot%" will automatically be replaced with the location of your
Windows NT file, which is likely

C:\WINDOWSNT
The default CONFIG.NT file has "FILES=20" in it, so you need to either
change the contents of CONFIG.NT probably

C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG.NT
or use the WindowsNT button on the Program page of the Properties panel to
use a different configuration file.

When all else fails, you can use the command line option "-desperate" to
tell Executor to use as few extended features of your computer as possible
in an attempt to avoid running into a problem.  Under DOS you just add
"-desperate to the command line, i.e.:

C:\> executor -desperate
Under Windows, you need to make a short-cut to Executor and then use the
Properties menu item to change the command line to include "-desperate".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.8.  E/D runs under DOS, but not from Windows.  What do I do?

There are several things you can check:

* Do you have FILES=30 or greater in the appropriate config file [see Q6.7
  `E/D dies during startup.  Why?']?
* Are you running in 386-enhanced mode?
* Is virtual memory turned on?
* Is your mouse driver loaded and enabled (not just installed)?

If this checking produces no insights, write to <questions@ardi.com> and
we'll try to track down the cause of the problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.9.  What causes errors when transferring files?

Error -42 is the error code generated inside a Macintosh when too many
files are open.  Executor internally generates this error when the
underlying operating system disallows the opening of a file.  This error
is usually symptomatic of not properly setting FILES in your config.sys
[see Q6.7 `E/D dies during startup.  Why?'].

Similar errors may result when you try to copy Macintosh file to a DOS
disk because many Macintosh file names are illegal under DOS.  You can fix
this by renaming the file to a normal DOS eight-dot-three name.

Executor versions that are older than 2.0j [available in mid June] have
trouble with Windows 95's long file names.  Specifically, any Macintosh
file with a control-character as part of its name will cause trouble, and
filenames will appear to all be in lower case.  2.0j solves these
problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.10.  Why does my screen look funny when I run Executor?

Your video driver may not be fully VESA compliant.  If Executor detects
VESA compliance, it will try to use VESA modes.  In general, this is a
good thing, however, if these modes have bugs in them, Executor will
invoke the bugs, and Executor may fail.  Try getting a newer driver for
your video card if this happens [see Q6.5 `What do I do if my Super VGA
card isn't VESA compliant?'].

NOTE: If you run Executor with the "-info" switch, Executor will print out
information it finds out about your video card.  That information may be
helpful in tracking down your problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.11.  Does E/D require an ASPI driver to access SCSI?

If your SCSI drivers patch the "INT 13" BIOS calls, then an ASPI driver is
not needed.  As long as "INT 13" can allow Executor to read a SCSI drive,
there is no need to use ASPI.  Similarly, if you have a 16-bit MSCDEX
CD-ROM driver installed, Executor will be able to see your CD-ROM drive
(whether it's SCSI or not) even without ASPI drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.12.  Have you released Executor for OS/2 yet?

We hope to make an OS/2 specific version of Executor, and many of the
modifications we've made to Executor to support Executor/Win32 will make a
port to OS/2 easier.  However, IBM hasn't been particularly good at
encouraging third party vendors like ourselves to do native ports to OS/2.
In the meantime, Executor/DOS works well under OS/2 Warp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.13.  Why won't Executor/DOS work with my Diamond Viper PCI card?

Executor/DOS requires VESA compliant graphics cards.  Many cards are not
directly VESA compliant and need a TSR to be run before they will work
with Executor/DOS.  On a Gateway computer, you can do this with the
"vprmode VESA" command [see Q6.5 `What do I do if my Super VGA card isn't
VESA compliant?'].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.14.  Why doesn't my mouse work when I run Executor under OS/2 Warp?

If it's not already there, you may need to add this line:
DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VMOUSE.SYS
to your CONFIG.SYS.  This, and related issues, are described on pages
206-207 of _User's Guide to OS/2 Warp_.  This line should already have
been added for you when you installed Warp.

Also, you may need to load MOUSE.COM in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, for example:
LOADHIGH C:\OS2\MDOS\MOUSE.COM
You can also create an AUTOEXEC file specifically for Executor, place it
in the same directory as Executor, and configure Warp to execute that file
whenever you launch Executor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.15.  Any OS/2 Warp suggestions?

Here is the advice of an Executor Enthusiast:

I haven't been having any problems with running Executor/DOS in
OS/2. What he needs to do (assuming he has Warp) is to run "Add
Programs" object in the "System Setup" folder. This will make a object
for Executor on his desktop (usually in the "Additional DOS Programs"
folder). Go into the settings for that object, and select the
"Session" tab. Set it to "DOS Full Screen", and choose "DOS
Settings". He wants "All DOS Settings". Primarily, Executor needs the
"DPMI Memory Limit" set to 16 megs, and "DPMI Memory Limit" set to
enabled. Since it defaults to 4 megs and automatic, it won't work. For
additional performance, he should set "DOS High" to on, "EMS Memory
Limit" to 0, "Video 8514a XGA IOtrap" to off, "Video Retrace
Emulation" to off, "XMS Memory Limit" to 0, and "XMS Minimum HMA" to
63. The biggest boost comes from "Session Priority". Set this to at
least 16, and if he is going to run no other programs, set it
higher. If he is going to run other programs, this should be left
at 16, and the "DOS Background Execution" needs to be set to on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.16.  Does Executor/DOS work under Windows 95?

Yes, Executor/DOS works well under Windows 95.  But you should run
Executor/Win32 under Windows 95.  It has fewer compatibility problems and
is just as fast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.17.  Executor/DOS dies, what should I do?

If Executor dies even running the demo applications, try temporarily
moving your config.sys and autoexec.bat files aside and create minimal
versions of each, leaving only the lines that you need to initialize your
mouse driver and the
FILES=30
line in your config.sys.  Then reboot and try running Executor.  If
Executor then starts working, you will have to slowly add back the things
that are in your normal autoexec.bat and config.sys files until you know
exactly what is causing the problem.  Once you know that, you should send
information to <bugs@ardi.com>.

If Executor only dies on a particular application, try increasing the
amount of RAM dedicated to the application by using the "-applzone" switch
when you run Executor.  Also try turning on "Pretend Sound" [see Q3.6 `Are
there other parameters I can adjust? [aka "Preferences Panel"]'], or if
the screen seems to be only partially updated, try turning on "Refresh".

Once you've done as much as you can to figure out the problem, send a bug
report via <http://www.ardi.com/bugform.html>.  Run Executor with the
"-info" switch and include that information.  Make sure you also include
the version of Executor you're running (e.g. Executor/DOS 2), the name and
version of the application that is dying (e.g. HyperCard 2.1), the name
and version of the operating system you're running (e.g. DOS 6.22) and
enough details to reproduce the crash (e.g. "start the application, choose
the "more Elvis" from the "adjust music" menu and the application will
crash").  If the application you are running is publicly available via
anonymous ftp, telling us where we can pick it up for testing purposes
also helps.

We accept bug reports from everyone, although paid customers' bug reports
are almost always higher priority than those of potential customers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.18.  How does printing work under E/D?

Executor/DOS will print directly to a PostScript-compatible printer if
started with the switch -printer lpt1 (or lpt2, lpt3, or whatever as
appropriate).  Otherwise, it prints to a PostScript file.  The first time
you print, the file will be named execout1.ps and will be located in the
same directory that executor.exe is located in. You can then print this
file on a PostScript printer, or if you have a PostScript compatible
driver, you can use a non-PostScript printer.  A popular PostScript
compatible printer drivers is Ghostscript, available for free
(<http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/>).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.19.  Why does E/D under Windows 3.x have problems hot-keying?

When you use a hot-key to switch away from Executor, Windows 3.x doesn't
know how to save the screen, because it only knows about the original VGA
screen modes, but Executor uses SVGA/VESA screen modes.  So when you
switch back, Windows 3.x doesn't know how to replace the screen with what
it used to contain.

This problem is further compounded by the fact that Executor has no way of
knowing when it's been switched out and switched back.  To make matters
worse, some Windows drivers (ATI Mach 32, for example) don't even restore
the mode properly, so not only will the screen be incorrect, but Executor
will die shortly after you switch back.

Luckily this is less frequently a problem in Windows 95 or OS/2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.20.  Why can't I eject or format my DOS formatted floppy?

Executor/DOS allows you to see DOS drives other than the drive you install
Executor on.  It also allows you to format floppies in the Macintosh
format (it used to read and write Mac formatted floppies, but it wouldn't
do the formatting itself).

Currently, the two abilities conflict.  What we do is if a DOS formatted
floppy is in the drive when E/D starts, we treat that drive as a fixed
drive from that point on.  You can no longer eject the floppy, nor can you
convince Executor to consider that floppy as a Mac formatted floppy or a
candidate for Mac formatting.  This is confusing and ugly; but we haven't
found a better solution yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.21.  Do E/D and QEMM fight?

We don't have QEMM in house for testing, but apparently older versions of
QDPMI are incompatible DPMI providers for Executor.  We have heard that
QEMM 8.0 works with Executor, but we have not tested it.  DPMI providers
that are known to work are the supplied CWSDPMI, the DPMI provider in
Windows 3.x and Windows 95, the DPMI provider in OS/2, and 386Max.

For now, if you have lines similar to these two:

DEVICE=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS /R:1 /SIZE=8880 C:\QEMM\QDPMI.SYS 

SWAPFILE=DPMI.SWP SWAPSIZE=1024.

in your config.sys file, you should "rem them out" -- i.e. add "rem " to
the beginning of each line -- at least when using Executor:

REM DEVICE=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS /R:1 /SIZE=8880 C:\QEMM\QDPMI.SYS 
REM SWAPFILE=DPMI.SWP SWAPSIZE=1024.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.22.  Does Executor fight with Novell DPMS?

Yes.  Novell DOS and Stacker both use this memory manager, but Executor
will crash when Novell DPMS (DOS Protected Mode Services) is running.
Fortunately, Stacker can be run without it if you are using another memory
manager such as 386Max.  Additionally, Stacker won't use DPMS when run
under Windows.

This is another compatibility problem that we're looking into, although it
has been reported that some other well known programs crash under DPMS's
DPMI support (PKZIP, Geoworks and Logic Magician's Oberon System).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.23.  How can I speed up Executor/DOS?

Executor/DOS is of course dependent on the speed and type of CPU in your
PC.  Obviously you can make E/D run faster if you upgrade your 386 to a
Pentium.  However, there are other, non-obvious ways in which sometimes
you can dramatically improve Executor's speed.

Use the "-info" switch to see how much DPMI memory you have compared to
how much physical memory you have.  In general, Executor itself will
consume approximately 2 MB of memory even if you could have an applzone,
syszone and stack size of 0 (which you can't).  So on a 4 MB system, you
can only allocate another 2 MB total to applzone, syszone and stack if you
want to avoid paging (paging slows Executor down considerably), and that's
only if you don't have drivers in your config.sys file or autoexec.bat
tying up more of your memory.  If you are low on memory, you should use
DOS's "mem" command and see how much Extended (XMS) memory DOS thinks you
have.  The more you can increase that figure before Executor starts up,
the more DPMI memory Executor will have and the easier it will be for
Executor to avoid paging.

*If* you have plenty of memory, then you can also speed Executor up a
little bit by running a disk cache.  However, you should only run the disk
cache in a write-through mode -- in other words you should enable the disk
cache so that all disk writes are immediately sent to the disk.  Failure
to do so may result in corrupt HFV files after Executor dies.

Executor can access video cards in three different ways.  The slowest is
by using VGA calls.  This is also the least flexible -- you are often
limited only to 16 colors when using VGA calls, since the only VGA mode
that supports 256 colors is too small to use with Executor.  If your card
is VESA compliant, or has a driver that makes it VESA compliant, Executor
can drive the video card more efficiently.  There are two major levels of
VESA compliance -- VESA 1.x and VESA 2.x.  Executor is even more efficient
if it can drive your video card using a VESA 2.0 driver, *if* that driver
supports "linear mapping".  The SciTech Display Doctor driver allows many
popular video cards to be linear mapped.  If you want Executor to run
quickly, you should probably pick up a copy of SciTech Display Doctor and
test it on your system to see if it improves things.  You can use
"Speedometer" or "Globe" to get a rough approximation of how much it
helps.  On many cards, use of SciTech Display Doctor can double Executor's
graphics speed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6.24.  How do I make Executor/DOS run faster under VirtualPC

Using the "-oldtimer" switch can speed Executor/DOS up by more than a
factor of two when it's running under VirtualPC, a PC emulator made by
Connectix <http://www.connectix.com/>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7.1.  How long has Executor been in development?

Work began in July of 1986.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7.2.  What techniques were used to rewrite the OS and Toolbox?

Entirely clean-room techniques.  That is to say none of the Apple ROMs or
Apple System File were ever disassembled.  Instead ROMlib (the section of
Executor that emulates the OS and Toolbox) was written from the manuals
"Inside Macintosh", and Tech. notes.  That isn't sufficient to get the
degree of compatibility that we need, so tests were written and run on
Macs to see what a real Mac would do.  In addition, we run applications
under Executor and when they deviate from how they would behave on a Mac,
we take a look at what is going on and fix Executor accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7.3.  Why not just use the Apple ROMS?

Since Executor has limited compatibility due to ARDI rewriting the
Macintosh system services, wouldn't it be possible to make Executor more
compatible by using Apple's ROMs, either licensing them from Apple or
requiring the end-user to obtain ROMs?  Shapeshifter (a Macintosh emulator
for the Amiga does) requires end-users to obtain ROMs, and it is more
compatible than Executor.

Apple doesn't license the 68k Mac ROMs, nor do they license MacOS in any
form to anyone who has a software only product.

We have approached Apple and requested the ability to license MacOS and
been rebuffed.  We will continue to try -- a combination of ARDI and Apple
code would be beneficial for both companies.  However, since Apple remains
intransigent, we're approaching the stage in development where ARDI could
use "clean-room/dirty-room" reverse engineering so that in the future,
many components from MacOS can be installed on top of Executor, once the
end user buys a copy of System 7.5.x.

Requiring end-users to purchase ROMs just wouldn't work.  ARDI's goal
isn't to sell small copies of Executor to the limited audience that can
legitimately procure Macintosh ROMs.  Although it has some limitations,
Executor 2 works right out of the box, with nothing else to purchase.
Requiring ROMs may be fine for Shapeshifter, but it will not work for
Executor's target audience.

Executor 2 already supports the vast majority of System 6 and System 7.0
features.  The features that have been added to MacOS beyond System 7.0
(like QuickTime) are often available as extensions, so when a future
version of Executor supports extensions, it will be possible for people to
use them to add functionality to Executor.

There have been many "Mac emulators" that use software from Apple,
including Liken, Shapeshifter, Amax, the Magic Sac and QUIX's "ports" of
the MacOS to NeXT computers and PREP machines.  Such retrofitting work
isn't particularly hard when compared to the reverse-engineering that
we've done.  It's also not particularly useful because the target audience
for all those products has been significantly smaller than the target
audience for Executor 2, and Executor 2 isn't ARDI's final product.  The
target audience for Executor 3, which will have more features and more
compatibility is significantly larger still.

Question 7.4.  What's next?

One big thing that we're working on is our "Win32" port of Executor.
Executor/Win32 is a native windows application for Windows 95 and Windows
NT.  Much of the Win32 port has already been done, and a demo version of
Executor/Win32 is available from our web site.

Beyond Executor 2, we want to make Executor compatible with Apple's MacOS
distributions, so you'll be able to purchase a copy of Apple's MacOS,
install it on top of Executor and get even more compatibility and
features.  This will be done incrementally at the same time that we work
on ports to other platforms.  The Executor mailing list (and its
reflection in comp.emulators.mac.executor) is a good source of information
about what we're currently doing.

Our plans for post-Executor 2 work are subject to change.  We try very
hard to spend development time on the right mix of implementing features
or fixing bugs that according to our existing customers desires and also
making modifications to Executor to make it more widely appealing.

Question 7.5.  May I bundle the DEMO version of Executor on a CD-ROM?

The short answer is "yes".

You are able to freely copy and distribute demo versions of Executor, as
long as you follow the restrictions set forth in Executor's license panel.
Please run the demo version of Executor and choose "About Executor..." to
see the restrictions that you must follow.

A suggestion: contact us to make sure you have the latest version of
Executor.  We can tell you if a new release is imminent.
