PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.  IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT
SIMPLY CHANGING A FILE TYPE WILL USUALLY NOT HELP.

This is a list of some of the more common Macintosh file types and
creators.  You can use Executor's Get Info function (under the File
menu, or Cmd-I for a keyboard shortcut) to set the file type and
creator, but please read the rest of this description before you do.

This is most useful when working with certain types of downloaded
files such as StuffIt archives, or when first importing a
cross-platform file such as a TIFF which was created on a PC.

***********************************************************************
* NOTE: This will not help you if the file that you transferred had   *
* important information in its resource fork.  For instance,          *
* applications will not work when you transfer just the data fork and *
* then set the type and creator, because applications contain CPU     *
* instructions in 'CODE' resources, which are not stored in the data  *
* fork.                                                               *
***********************************************************************

Some of the entries in this table are known to *not* require any
information in the resource fork.  StuffIt archives, Compact Pro
archives, and Word formatted data are three examples, but some of the
document types listed herein may indeed require information in the
resource fork.  In those cases, simply changing creator and type is
unlikely to be beneficial.

In general, it's best to transfer Mac files either by having Executor
read Mac formatted media (like floppies, zip drives or hard disks), or
by first converting the Mac files into HQX format, since it is the
most portable format.  If you're a power user and you can make use of
the information in this table, that's great, but if not, it's less
error prone to just always use HQX as an intermediate form.

Note too that Executor directly recognizes only a few file types.
Others which do not have their own resource fork icons will be
displayed with the "unknown" icon -- a blue circle with a red question
mark.  This does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong
with the file; it only means that Executor does not have a
predetermined icon for it.
