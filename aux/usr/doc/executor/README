Please consider letting Macintosh developers know about your Executor
successes.  If an application runs well under Executor, ARDI offers
porting technology that will allow the developer to quickly port that
application to Linux, or any other platform that runs Executor
(Windows, DOS).

Please remember, Executor is a commercial* program.  Please see the
file License_Fees for current Executor pricing.
