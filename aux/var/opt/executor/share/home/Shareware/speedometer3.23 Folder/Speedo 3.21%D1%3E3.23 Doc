This build is for Speedometer version number 3.23VERSION 3.22Fixed crash bug that caused system crashes on some Macs upon quitting the program.VERSION 3.22Fixed bug that caused the loaded record file to be closed if you printed the comparison graphs. Added NEW PR rating calculation and option to display it in the graph. Added the ability to copy the graph window to the clipboard.VERSION 3.21Removed extra system beeps that people found annoying. Made the program work with 16bit and 24bit graphics - fixed a bug from Apple's example code... oops. Added a routine to sort record names in the analysis popups - another Apple bug... oops. Fixed some potentially messsy memory allocation problems.Version 3.2Added iterations to all tests. Added text file display. Added ability to save a report from an external record. Fixed export data bugs. Cleaned up icons. Extended range of graph to account for faster machines. Added Preferences for file creators for text files. Various minor cosmetic changes. Changed virus checking scheme to avoid warnings when changing Size requirements from the Finder.Version 3.11Added icons for Quadras and Powerbooks to the hardware display. Added recognition of and proper name display for the LCII -- had to special case it since Apple's routines return the same name for both machines.Version 3.1Fixes a potential problem with 68040 machines. This change has caused a change in the timing of the tests which makes previous machine records inaccurate when compared with those of this version. Fixed a bug in the Merge Records command. Added the ability to edit comments in external machine records. Added the ability to interrupt a series of tests with command-period. Added preferences to save window positions and to autoload the Machine Records file. Fixed a bug in the version error dialog for the Analysis window.Version 3.06Fixes a crash bug in exporting data to Excel. Also, now check for old system versions and try to accomodate them (6.04 and earlier). Also, Run All Tests will now no longer try to do a graphics mode not present on the machine.Version 3.05Fixes a crash bug introduced in 3.04 in the report generation module. Adds Merge Record Files and Edit External Comment commands.Version 3.04Fixed a problem which caused the PR Math score to be displayed as twice the real value. This fix affects the result displayed, but not what was stored, so all records are still good.Version 3.03Fixed some menu problems and a couple of small cosmetic things.Version 3.02Fixed a potential crash bug in the color quickdraw tests. No changes to any data structures. Version number 3.01.This build addresses some complaints from users, as well as fixing a serious bug in the FPU tests. Unfortunately, the FPU code needed extensive modification which affects the timing of the tests. AS A RESULT, MACHINE RECORDS SAVED WITH VERSION 3.0 WILL NOT DISPLAY VALID RESULTS FOR THE FPU TESTS. I suggest pitching any old records and creating new ones with this version.-sb
