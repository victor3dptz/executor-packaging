What's new in StuffIt Expander==============================This document briefly outlines new features and enhancements that have been added to the StuffIt Expander package.  For more detailed information and instructions please read the file titled “StuffIt Expander™ Read Me” located in the “Read Us First!” folder.StuffIt Expander 4.0.1------------------Bug Fixes---------* Under certain circumstances, when only StuffIt Expander 4.0 were present on the system, StuffIt archives would appear as generic documents in the Finder.  This problem affected the appearance of StuffIt archive icons only, and did not affect the operation of the Expander, or the integrity of archive data.  Also this icon appearance problem would NOT normally affect users of StuffIt Deluxe, StuffIt Lite, StuffIt SpaceSaver, or DropStuff, who also happened to have Expander on their systems.  We did, however, feel that the problem should be fixed for our free-standing Expander product, on behalf of our many customers who have installed and use only the StuffIt Expander.* If there were no Expander Enhancer in the system, StuffIt Expander 4.0 would sometimes quit an expansion session prematurely, when an item were encountered which could only be expanded in the presence of the Expander Enhancer (e.g., a ZIP archive).  Expander 4.0.1 behaves properly:  items that cannot be expanded without the Enhancer are skipped if the Enhancer is not present, and all other items are expanded as expected.  The fact that some items were skipped is correctly reported at the end of the session.* If the destination preference were set to “Use” but the volume it were on could not be found, the alert that would come up had an empty folder name. Expander 4.0.1 now displays the folder name in the alert, regardless of why the folder could not be found.* Sub-preference items are now properly disabled, if necessary, when the preferences panel to which they belong is first displayed.* If a path is defined for the “Use...” destination folder, but the current preference is set to something else, clicking the “Use” radio button no longer brings up the Standard File dialog. Expander simply uses the path that is shown in the preference panel. The Standard File dialog still appears when no path is defined, and when the user clicks the “Select” button.* Under certain circumstances, expanding folders to a destination that was different than the source location (e.g., when employing the "Use..." destination preference), would result in an internal error that would cause Expander 4.0 to terminate the session before all the selected files were expanded.StuffIt Expander 4.0------------------New Features--------------* Faster, especially on Power Macintosh computers* More intelligent. Now properly detects file type by file header information. Expander no longer dependent on using file name extensions.* Added a "Cross Platform" preference to the preferences panel. Now supports text conversion option if you are using a non-Macintosh-based expansion engine. (.uu, .zip, .arc).* Supports expansion of TapeARchive (.tar ) files* Added a "Create folder" preference if you have multiple items in an archive.* Now supports multi-file and segmented file support for BinHex. Expander handles multiple files in a single text document, as well as file broken into several pieces. Also no longer requires specific "header" lines when decoding.* With Drop Stuff with Expander Enhancer installed, Expander now handles UUCode decoding of multiple files in a single text document, as well as file broken into several pieces. Also, no longer requires specific "header" lines when decoding.* Now uses Internet Config (if present) when expanding non-Macintosh-basedfiles to determine what file type & creator to give each file.* Much better behaved when called via AppleScript or Apple events.Bug Fixes---------*When Delete Originals is selected it no longer deletes originals after unsuccessful expansions. StuffIt Expander 3.5.2--------------------New Features------------* Users of System 7.5 can now drop folders and/or disks on the Expander icon to expand an entire folder or disk worth of files.* Incorporated support for Rival.  Users of Rival will have their newly expanded files automatically checked for viruses.Bug Fixes---------* Fixed a problem where StuffIt archives would not get expanded.* Users of a 68000 based Macintoshes (MacPlus, PB100, etc.) will no longer have problems when decoding MacBinary files.StuffIt Expander 3.5.1----------------------This version does not unexpectedly expire. StuffIt Expander 3.5--------------------New Key Modifiers-----------------While dragging and dropping a file on StuffIt Expander... * Holding down the control key will delete the original file when expansion is finished. * Holding down the option key brings up the one-time preferences dialog.  Any preferences you set in the preferences dialog will be used only for that expansion. When choosing “Expand…” from the File menu... * Holding down the Shift key will cause Expander to scan the "Watch Folder" before the designated time. * Holding down the command key will bring up a special "Expand folder" dialog.  After selecting a folder, Expander will scan the folder and expand any files it can.New Features------------* Expander will now expand MacBinary files.* New Preferences Dialog with a whole new look! * You can now specify Expander to either prompt for a destination, or use a default folder for expansion.  That destination will apply to all files to be expanded.* When aborting an expansion, you can now choose to abort only that file or all files.* You can now paste passwords into the password dialog while expanding encrypted archives.* Expander will now auto-rename files and folders to prevent colliding with expanded items of the same name.* Expander will now expand the result file of an expand. In other words, users who drop a “foo.sit.hqx” file on Expander will see a BinHex expansion, and then a StuffIt archive expansion, leaving you with a fully expanded file!  You may also choose to turn this option off.* If Expander is expanding a .cpt archive that contains comments, the comments are written to a separate text file at the same level as the expanded items.Other Improvements------------------* Expander now performs better in conditions such as low memory & lack of disk space.* If an error occurs when Expander is in the background, it will now notify you.* The Watch Folder feature is now more reliable.* Using Expander from AppleScript, UserLand Frontier (and other scripting systems) is now more reliable.* Added additional support for Macintosh Easy Open.AppleLink Package Expansion--------------------------AppleLink package expansion is no longer supported with StuffIt Expander, the stand-alone freeware application.  However, users of DropStuff with Expander Enhancer will be able to expand AppleLink packages, as well as a host of other compression formats.
