More Lemmings requires a monochrome Macintosh with 1 Mb of memory, or a 256-color Macintosh with at least 2 megabytes of memory running System 6.0.5 and 32-bit Quickdraw.  System 7 will require an additional megabyte of memory.On slower machines, the Faster menu option will automatically be activated.  This reduces the amount of animation on the screen to improve game speed.On 12" (or smaller) monitors, the menu bar will not be visible at all times.  Press the Command key and space bar on your keyboard to make the menu bar appear.Starting Lemmings=================Make a folder on your hard drive called "Oh No!  More Lemmings".  Copy the contents of the floppy disk into this folder.  Double-click on the Oh No!!  More Lemmings application to begin.The Game=========Lemmings is an intriguing game in which you help hordes of otherwise mindless rodents (known as Lemmings) escape 120 hostile environments.  Oh No!  More Lemmings is an expansion disk for the original Lemmings,, containing 100 all-new levels of adventure for the little rodents.  (You are currently playing a four-level demonstration version of Oh No!  More Lemmings.)Lemmings drop through a trapdoor on to each screen and they need all the help they can get to survive the dangers thereon.To assist these cuddly, yet suicidally stupid, creatures you use your mouse (similar to a Lemming but it has more buttons) to select a skill from the panel of icons at the base of the screen. Once highlighted you then choose a suitable Lemming, from the throng on the screen, to perform that skill. You have a strict time limit in which to get a required percentage of the little perishers through each level.A quick brain, the ability to plan ahead, and a lifetime dedication to the Save a Lemming Campaign are what's required to get the right Lemming to perform the right action at the right time. A forgotten Blocker or a misplaced bridge could spell disaster for every Lemming on the screen.Controls======== 1. Use your mouse 2. Point and click on chosen icon to highlight it then (if required)     point and click on selected Lemming to put that Lemming to     work. 3. Pushing your mouse to the left or right edges of screen scrolls     the play area. 4. After you set up a level, and the Lemmings are heading out the     exit, then hold down the Shift key to hurry them along.Icons (from left to right)=======================  1.
